BGP Hijack Detection Tool
Real-time BGP monitoring for detecting unauthorized route announcements and potential prefix hijacks.

üöÄ Features
‚úÖ Real-time BGP monitoring using the RIS-Live WebSocket feed.
‚úÖ Detect unauthorized prefix announcements and BGP hijacks.
‚úÖ Instant alerts via email and Better Stack Webhooks.
‚úÖ Efficient queue-based processing to handle large-scale BGP updates.
‚úÖ Automatic reconnection mechanism in case of WebSocket disconnects.

üõ† Installation
1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/Menuka-Wijayarathne/bgp-hijack-detector.git
cd bgp-hijack-detector

2Ô∏è‚É£ Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional)
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
myenv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (config.yaml)
Modify config.yaml to customize the prefixes to monitor, email settings, and webhook alerts.
Edit the config.yaml file to specify:

Prefixes to monitor (e.g., 31.170.120.0/21).
Expected ASN for each prefix (e.g., 20738).
Webhook URL for Better Stack alerts.
Email settings (SMTP server, sender, recipients, etc.).

Example config.yaml

prefixes:
  "31.170.120.0/21": 20738
  "46.32.224.0/19": 20738

betterstack_webhook: "https://uptime.betterstack.com/api/v1/incoming-webhook/your-webhook-id"

email_settings:
  enabled: true
  sender_email: "bgp-hijack@yourdomain.com"
  recipient_email:
    - "alert1@yourdomain.com"
    - "alert2@yourdomain.com"
  smtp_server: "10.93.131.42"
  smtp_port: 25
  use_authentication: false

  ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Tool

  To start real-time monitoring:(select correct interpreter path)

  python bgp_hijack_detector.py

if you need to run this as a background process, better to configure a seperate systemd service for this.

This will:

Subscribe to the RIPE RIS Live WebSocket feed.
Monitor and log AS paths for configured prefixes.
Trigger alerts for hijacked prefixes.
Store logs for later analysis.


üìÅ Log Files
bgp_as_paths.log ‚Üí Logs all AS paths received.
bgp_processed.log ‚Üí Logs hijack detections.
bgp_hijacks.log ‚Üí General application logs.

üîÑ Troubleshooting
1Ô∏è‚É£ No Alerts Being Sent?
Check config.yaml to ensure prefixes and ASN values are correctly set.
Verify your SMTP server is reachable (ping your-smtp-server).
Ensure the WebSocket connection is active (check logs for disconnect messages).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Getting WebSocket Disconnects?
The WebSocket may limit connections. Ensure only one instance is running.
If experiencing frequent disconnects, increase the ping_interval in the WebSocket configuration.
